# NgRx

NgRx is an open source library that provides reactive state management for your Angular applications. Inspired by Redux, NgRx provides a way to maintain..

State management can be performed in following ways

- Through component’s interaction via decorators `@Input` bindings and `@Output` event emitters;
- Through Angular services by using simple variables and `Promises`;
- `Observable` to watch for data changes via `RxJs`.
